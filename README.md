Associate Software Engineer - Coding Challenge
I'm glad to have received your application, and we're happy to take you through
the interview process. The first step is a coding challenge.
The challenge consists of 2 problem statements designed to understand your
coding and problem solving skills.

1. https://github.com/syook/node-logistics
2. https://github.com/syook/general-problem-solving
   The above mentioned links will take you to the problem statements which are
   quite self-explanatory.
   ● Please submit your codes/responses on a Github link within 24 hours
   of receiving the assignment.
   ● Do not attempt to copy/seek external help. We are looking to hire you, not
   your friends who helped you do it. Any such practices will be flagged off
   immediately and you will be removed from the interview process at that
   very instance.
   Feel free to reach out at nischal@syook.com should you have any queries or
   concerns. Wishing you the best of luck and hope you see you on the other side!
